# Preview Every Safe

## Overview

Allow all skins from all safes to be previewed from the Steam Inventory menu. Adds the Completely OVERKILL safe, restores the removed weapon safes (John Wick, Bodhi, Jimmy, Scarface), and restores removed weapon skins. Adds a prompt to choose the preview wear.

## Known Issues

This mod modifies the tweak_data of the contents of safes. May mess with the visual loot table when opening safes. This has not been tested since safes don't drop anymore.
